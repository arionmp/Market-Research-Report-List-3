<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual</li><li>Automatic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) devices can be categorized into manual and automatic types. Manual CPR devices require the rescuer to physically compress the patient's chest to the beat of a metronome, while automatic devices perform compressions automatically at a set rate and depth. Manual devices are typically used by trained professionals in hospital settings, while automatic devices are more commonly found in public places for bystanders to use during emergencies. Both types are crucial in saving lives during cardiac arrest situations.</p></p>
