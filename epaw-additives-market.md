<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EP/AW Additives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>EP Additives</li><li>AW Additives</li></ul></p>
<p><p>EP additives, also known as extreme pressure additives, are used in lubricants to reduce friction and wear in metal-to-metal contact under high pressure conditions. These additives form a protective film on the metal surfaces to prevent damage. On the other hand, AW additives, or anti-wear additives, work by forming a protective layer on metal surfaces to minimize wear and tear. Both EP and AW additives are essential components in lubricants for automobiles, industrial machinery, and other applications where metal surfaces are constantly in contact.</p></p>
