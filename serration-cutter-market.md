<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Serration Cutter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Milling</li><li>Hob</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Serration cutters are specialized tools used in metalworking for creating serrations or grooves on workpieces. There are two main types of serration cutters: milling and hob cutters. Milling serration cutters are used for milling operations, while hob serration cutters are used for hobbing operations. Milling serration cutters operate by rotating the cutter and moving it linearly across the workpiece. Hob serration cutters, on the other hand, use a series of cutting edges on a cylindrical tool to create serrations on the workpiece. Both types of serration cutters are essential in manufacturing industries for producing precision parts.</p></p>
