<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-Expanding Metal Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fully</li><li>Partially</li><li>Uncovered</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Self-expanding metal stents can be categorized into three main types based on their design and coverage: fully covered, partially covered, and uncovered. Fully covered stents are encased in a silicone membrane that prevents tissue ingrowth, making them suitable for strictures and malignant lesions. Partially covered stents have both covered and uncovered sections, offering a balance between tissue ingrowth prevention and fluid drainage. Uncovered stents have no covering, providing better fluid drainage but increasing the risk of tissue overgrowth.</p></p>
