<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Chromatography Purification Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Step Purification</li><li>Multiple-Step Purification</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Liquid chromatography purification market types include single-step purification and multiple-step purification. Single-step purification involves a simple and fast process where the target compound is separated in one chromatographic step. This method is ideal for purifying a single compound or isolating a specific target molecule. On the other hand, multiple-step purification involves a series of chromatographic steps to achieve higher purity levels or separate complex mixtures containing multiple components. This method is more time-consuming but allows for a higher degree of purification.</p></p>
