<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Pneumatic Cylinder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Double Acting</li><li>Single Acting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Rotary Pneumatic Cylinder market has two main types: Double Acting and Single Acting. Double Acting cylinders use air pressure to both extend and retract the piston, providing more precise control over movement. Single Acting cylinders, on the other hand, use air pressure to move the piston in one direction, with the return stroke being accomplished by a spring or external force. Each type offers specific advantages depending on the application requirements and desired level of control.</p></p>
