<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ECMO Oxygenator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>V-V-ECMO Oxygenator</li><li>V-A-ECMO Oxygenator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>ECMO Oxygenator is a medical device used in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy to support patients with severe respiratory or cardiac failure. There are two main types of ECMO Oxygenators - V-V-ECMO Oxygenator and V-A-ECMO Oxygenator. V-V-ECMO Oxygenator is used for patients with isolated respiratory failure, while V-A-ECMO Oxygenator is used for patients with combined respiratory and cardiac failure. Both types of ECMO Oxygenators help provide oxygenated blood to the patient's body outside of their own heart and lungs, allowing time for their organs to recover.</p></p>
