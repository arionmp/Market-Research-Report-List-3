<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bridge Expansion Joints Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Joints</li><li>Closed Joints</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bridge expansion joints are essential components that allow a bridge to expand and contract with temperature changes. There are two main types of bridge expansion joints: Open Joints and Closed Joints. Open joints are designed to allow for movement in one direction only, typically used in smaller bridges or pedestrian walkways. Closed joints, on the other hand, allow for movement in multiple directions and are commonly used in larger bridges or highways. Each type of joint serves a specific purpose based on the size and location of the bridge.</p></p>
