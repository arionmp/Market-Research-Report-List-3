<p><strong>The Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aortic Stenosis</li><li>Aortic Regurgitation</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat various heart conditions. It is primarily used to treat Aortic Stenosis, a narrowing of the aortic valve that restricts blood flow, and Aortic Regurgitation, a condition where the aortic valve does not close properly, leading to blood leakage. TAVI can also be used for other conditions such as bicuspid aortic valves or failed surgical valves. This procedure offers a less invasive alternative to open-heart surgery for patients with these conditions.</p></p>
