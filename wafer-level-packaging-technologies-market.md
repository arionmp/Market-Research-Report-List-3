<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wafer Level Packaging Technologies Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fan-In Wafer-Level Packaging</li><li>Fan-Out Wafer-Level Packaging</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wafer Level Packaging (WLP) technologies offer high-density interconnect solutions for semiconductor devices. Fan-In WLP involves placing the active area of the chip face-down on the substrate, connecting it with wire bonds, and then encapsulating it. Fan-Out WLP, on the other hand, redistributes the I/O connections across the chip, allowing for more I/Os and potentially thinner packages. Both technologies provide smaller form factors, lower costs, and improved performance compared to traditional packaging methods.</p></p>
