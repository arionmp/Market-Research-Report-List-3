<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neuro Monitoring Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sub-Sensory Evoked Potentials</li><li>Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials</li><li>Visual Evoked Potentials</li><li>Somatosensory-Evoked Potentials</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Neuro monitoring systems are used to assess the functioning of the nervous system during surgical procedures. Types of neuro monitoring systems include Sub-Sensory Evoked Potentials, which monitor responses to sensory stimuli below the level of consciousness. Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials assess the auditory pathway from the ear to the brainstem. Visual Evoked Potentials test the visual pathway from the eye to the occipital lobe. Somatosensory-Evoked Potentials evaluate the sensory pathway from peripheral nerves to the cerebral cortex. These systems provide valuable information to prevent neurological damage during surgery.</p></p>
