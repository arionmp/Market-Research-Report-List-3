<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small Electric Vehicles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>BEV</li><li>PHEV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Small electric vehicles market is dominated by two main types - Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV). BEVs run solely on electricity stored in batteries, resulting in zero tailpipe emissions. PHEVs have both a conventional engine and a battery-powered motor, allowing for some all-electric driving with the option to switch to gasoline when needed. BEVs are better for short, urban trips while PHEVs provide more flexibility for longer journeys. Both types are growing in popularity due to their environmental benefits and government incentives.</p></p>
