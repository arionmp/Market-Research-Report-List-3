<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Track Geometry Trolley Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Measurement</li><li>Non-contact Measurement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Track Geometry Trolley Market is divided into two main types: Contact measurement and Non-contact measurement. Contact measurement involves physical contact between the trolley and the track surface to gather data on track geometry. This method is more traditional and provides accurate measurements. On the other hand, non-contact measurement requires no physical contact with the track surface and utilizes laser or video technology to collect data. This method is becoming increasingly popular due to its efficiency and convenience. Both types cater to the needs of railway maintenance and inspection.</p></p>
